# Checking the Credibility of Press Articles using Python & Machine Learning

The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the process of creating a machine learning model working with text. 
The created model's task is to verify articles provided by the user and return an appropriate message - credible or not credible.

The communication between the model and the user is carried out through a web application written in Python using the Dash library.
